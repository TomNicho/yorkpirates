## Story Boards
During our initial discussion as a group regarding how our game should look like, we came up with several ideas which are shown in our Story Boards below:

*S.B.1*
 
 
![SB2](/media/Storyboard2.PNG)
*S.B.2*


![SB3](/media/Storyboard3.PNG)
*S.B.3*


![SB4](/media/Storyboard4.PNG)
*S.B.4*


Based on our storyboards, we then designed a Use Case diagram (as shown in the "Use Case" section on our website"), based of which we then designed a State Diagram to show how we will transition between different states of the game. The UML State Diagram is shown below:

Based on our UML State Diagram, we were then able to plan out an Abstract Representation of the architecture of our game using UML Class Diagrams which is shown below:

Once our implementation was complete, we were able to make the Concrete Representation of the architecture of our game using UML CLass Diagrams which is shown below:
